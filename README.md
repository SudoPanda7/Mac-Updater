# Mac-Updater
script to run updates for Macs

In order for either of the MacUpdaters to run correctly, you will need admin priveleges for your computer. 
The MacUpdaterResourceInstaller is used to install other programs utilized in the MacUpdaterDailyTasks.

Those resources are as follows:

  Git: Utilized to install SpeedTestCli. It will check what your current version of Git is, if it is     outdated or not already instaled, it will install or update Git.
  SpeedTestCLI: used to check current internet connection speed. 
  Check Root Kit: used to check your machine and see if it has a detected root kit on it.
  
That's it! Nothing heavy, just a few items used in the DailyTask program.
